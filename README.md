# QuartzIcons

QuartzIcons is a proof of concept to convert SVG images into Swift 3 Core
Graphics code.

This is the result of just a day of work, and it's not ready for prime time yet.
The code works for the [specific set of icons](https://github.com/automattic/gridicons) I was working on, but it doesn't implement the full SVG specification.
So far it can process paths, rects, and polygons.
